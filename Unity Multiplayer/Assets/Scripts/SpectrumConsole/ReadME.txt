Brief Instructions for this Console:

Drag & Drop the SpectrumConsole-Prefab to your Scene. Press End-Key To toggle Console (On/Off).
Type Help to see all Pre- written Commands. 
When you type One letter, if there is an available function, you can autofill the blue marked suggestion with TAB-Key.
If there are multiple suggestions, you can navigate with the Up and Down keys from your Numpad between the suggestions.
If the Method that you want to call requires a Parameter: string, float, bool: It will show as [string], [int], [bool].
Simply backspace to remove the requirement and add yours!
Example: PrintThisWord [string] 
How to call it: PrintThisWord MyWord

How to create your Custom Methods that are callable in the Console:
Simply add before your Method: [Console] AND add: using SpectrumConsole;
It doesnt matter if the Method is Public or Private, it will get called. Make Sure the Method you wanna call is attached
to a class that's active in the Scene!
The Autofill will now also show you your own Functions and its requirement if there is one.
Note: Methods callable from Console can ONLY receive string, bool, float.

Have FUN!
